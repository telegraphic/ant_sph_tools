DATA INFORMATION

Data description:
This dataset supports a paper in preparation for the AGU journal "Radio Science", which strongly encourages open data access. The MATLAB files/scripts (.m) were either created by myself or auto-created by MATLAB as part of my research at Curtin. The .sph files are spherical mode files in TICRA/GRASP format.

Number of files & types: 8 .m files
7 .sph files
Special software required to open files: MATLAB
